# timed-calculator
Quick calculator app coded in an hour to test development speed. Implements basic arithmetic functions.

Some thoughts:
Mix of xib and programatic isn't ideal; I'd rather commit entirely to a programmatic approach. Fixed value for textfield isn't ideal, as it might look odd for extremely large screens or small screens; should probably be set to a third of the screen height instead. For a more advanced calculator, I'd probably implement a queue to handle order of operations.
